<b>Plant Lore</b>
Native Americans consumed the seeds for their flavor and nutrients. A tea made from the stems and leaves was used to treat various medical problems such as eye infections, stomach disorders, and swellings. Livestock exhibits a state of drowsiness when feeding on Blue Flax. Blue Flax was used by many Native American tribes in making strong rope. Today a cultivated flax is still grown for its "linen" fiber and "linseed oil".
